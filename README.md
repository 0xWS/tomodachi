# Introduction
After other social medias decline, I decided to create my own take on social media: Tomodachi. The core idea is to keep things as simple as possible, while offering users a wide range of customization options. This isn't just about personalizing profiles â€“ Tomodachi aims to let users fine-tune their algorithmic experience too.

# Features
- Minimalistic but modern UI
- User profile editing and possibility of following others
## TODO:
- User profile customisation
- Customisable algorithm
